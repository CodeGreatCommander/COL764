They must be paired with other generators of equivalent power to compensate for wind variations and for the stability of the electricity grid. This pairing—wind and backup—has limits because of the huge rapid variability of wind that must be compensated for by the backup power source."

Their base 60 fraction system which we still use today (degrees / hours, minutes and seconds) was much easier to calculate with than the fractions used in Egypt or Greece, and remained the main calculation tool for astronomers until after the 16th century, when decimal notation began to take over."

Goode, and by kicking off the track with “One, two, THREE o’clock, four o’clock ROCK!”“Rock Around the Clock” climbed to number one in large part because it was the theme music to “Blackboard Jungle,” the 1955 Glenn Ford film that linked rock and roll to a whole range of juvenile delinquencies, from the smashing of jazz albums to attempted rape. During a nineteen-fifties revival, nearly twenty years later, “Rock Around the Clock” was chosen to be the first track on the “American Graffiti” soundtrack, was the theme song for the first two seasons of “Happy Days” and, in 1974, briefly returned to the Billboard Top 40. This nostalgic, early-nineteen-seventies moment presented rock and roll, and Haley’s record in particular, as good, clean fun, a flashback to music now devoid of its former ability to scare as well as to delight."

"who is rep scalise?","While Scalise has said he detests hate groups, a Louisiana reporter told The New York Times that he had described himself to her as “David Duke without the baggage.” It’s unclear whether Scalise was suggesting that he shared Duke’s racist views, or whether he was simply suggesting he shared Duke’s conservative values. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) has backed Scalise since he has come under fire from the White House and congressional Democrats, including civil rights icon John Lewis. Scalise this week agreed to meet with the head of a civil rights group that had criticized him for his 2002 speech.
